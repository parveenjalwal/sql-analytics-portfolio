#  1. Data Exploration : 

-- Counted the total number of records in the dataset
select count(*) from zepto ; 

-- Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content 
-- reading first twenty rows of all cols 
select *
from zepto 
limit 20 ;   


-- Checked for null values across all columns 
select * 
from zepto 
where category is null 
or name is null 
or mrp is null 
or discountPercent is  null 
or availableQuantity is null 
or discountedSellingPrice is null 
or weightInGms is null 
or outOfStock is null 
or quantity is null ;   


-- Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset
select distinct category as unique_category
from zepto ; 

-- Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts 
select outOfStock , count(*) as total_stock_Count

-- Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs 
-- a. products who is persent more then once twice in data

#  2. Data Cleaning

-- 1. Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero 

delete from zepto 
where mrp = 0 and discountedSellingPrice = 0 ; 
 
-- 2. Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability 

alter table zepto  add column upd_mrp int ; 
alter table zepto  add column upd_disprice int ; 

UPDATE zepto

select category , name , weightInGms ,
