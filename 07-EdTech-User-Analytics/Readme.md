# 🧑‍💻 SQL Mentor User Performance Analysis

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is designed to help beginners understand **SQL querying** and **performance analysis** using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. Analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions.  
> **Goal:** Solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn SQL for data analysis: **aggregation**, **filtering**, **ranking**
- Calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset
- Hands-on with SQL functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `EXTRACT()`, `DENSE_RANK()`
- Develop performance analysis skills by solving user data problems

---

## 🏷️ Project Level: Beginner

Created for beginners familiar with **SQL basics** and eager to handle real-world data analysis tasks. Work with a small dataset and write SQL for typical analytics scenarios.

---

## 📊 SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset

The dataset contains information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:
- User ID
- Question ID
- Points Earned
- Submission Timestamp
- Username

This enables performance analysis for:
- Correct/incorrect submissions
- Total points earned
- Daily/weekly activity tracking
